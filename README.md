Getting Started
---------------

1. Set up your project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Paste initialization snippet into `index.html` with the one generated from
   the Firebase Console **Overview > Add Firebase to your web app**. See TODO in
   `index.html`.
3. Use the generated Instance ID token to send an HTTP request to FCM that
   delivers the message to the web application, inserting appropriate values
   for [YOUR-SERVER-KEY](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging)
   and YOUR-IID-TOKEN.


### App focus
The browser gives your app focus when both:

1. Your app is running in the currently selected browser tab.
2. The browser tab's window currently has focus, as defined by the operating system.
